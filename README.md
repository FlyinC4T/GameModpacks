github better, fuck steam collections (they don't save configs 🥵)
# My Terraria Modpack (C4TPack)
This is a modpack, which can be played with TModLoader.
- The pack includes Calamity with some of Fargo's mods, along with multiple QoL' and vanilla tweaking mods.
- There is, on the other hand - cheat sheet and hero's mod, both not intentionally for "advantages", but rather host management, building, discovering/testing/"figuring out what something is" and "just incase I accidentally dropped my soul of the universe into the lava"-kind of stuff.
# Notes (Good to know)
The mods update on their own, but the modpack doesn't, so if you see the modpack update here on the github, it's probably best getting the new changes, unless playing with personalized configuration/mods.
The biggest difference with *this modpack* and just downloading mods manually, is the configurations and specified mods used.

Aside from that, it's easy to update the modpack by simply following the same steps as the first time. Feel free to change anything you want, let me know if anything should added / changed / removed or fixed!

## How to install (ZIP Method)
1. Download the ZIP of the pack.
2. Insert the C4TPack (likely from `TerrariaModpack_main.zip`) with your modpack directory.
3. Now enter TModLoader, and download the missing mods from the modpack.
